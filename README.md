# Tribute Page: Srinivasa Ramanujan



Welcome to my Tribute Page dedicated to the eminent Indian mathematician, Srinivasa Ramanujan! This project was completed as part of my internship with CODSOFT.

## Project Overview

In this task, I had the opportunity to combine my foundational knowledge of HTML and CSS to create a visually captivating webpage honoring the extraordinary life and achievements of Srinivasa Ramanujan. Ramanujan's contributions to the field of mathematics have left an indelible mark on the world, and this project allowed me to express my admiration in a personalized and artistic manner.

## Features and Highlights

- **Responsive Design:** The webpage is designed to provide an optimal viewing experience across various devices, ensuring accessibility for all users.
- **Engaging Visuals:** Thoughtfully chosen images are incorporated to visually narrate Ramanujan's journey and showcase key moments in his life.
- **Typography Experimentation:** I played with different font styles to enhance readability and add a touch of sophistication to the content.
